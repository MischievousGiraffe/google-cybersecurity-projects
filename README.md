# Google Cybersecurity Professional Projects

This repository contains my completed projects, labs, and exercises from the **Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate**. Each project reflects real-world cybersecurity tasks and showcases my ability to analyze threats, secure networks, and respond to incidents using industry-standard tools and methodologies.

## 🔍 Overview

Throughout this certification, I gained hands-on experience in key cybersecurity domains, including:

- **Security Operations (SOC) Analysis** — Investigating alerts and analyzing logs to detect suspicious activities.
- **Incident Response** — Documenting and responding to potential security incidents.
- **Network Security** — Configuring firewalls, reviewing network traffic, and mitigating vulnerabilities.
- **Asset & Risk Management** — Identifying assets, assessing risk, and implementing security controls.
- **Threat Analysis & OSINT** — Analyzing phishing attempts and malicious indicators using open-source tools.
